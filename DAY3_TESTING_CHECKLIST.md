- [ ] Color coding clear (ground truth vs prediction)

---

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue 1: "Out of memory" during training**
- **Solution:** Reduce batch size from 16 to 8 or 4
- **Edit Cell:** Find `BATCH_SIZE = 16` and change to `BATCH_SIZE = 8`

**Issue 2: Training too slow (>40 min)**
- **Check:** GPU is enabled (Runtime → Change runtime type)
- **Solution:** Restart runtime, re-enable GPU

**Issue 3: "Module not found" errors**
- **Solution:** Re-run package installation cells
- **Restart:** Runtime → Restart runtime, run all cells again

**Issue 4: Synthetic data generation hangs**
- **Solution:** Reduce sample count: `n_train=400` instead of 800
- **Won't affect:** Learning objectives, just less data

---

## 2. Session 4 Notebook Testing (Object Detection)

### File to Test
`course_site/day3/notebooks/Day3_Session4_Object_Detection_STUDENT.ipynb`

### Pre-Test Setup (2 min)
1. Open notebook in Google Colab
2. Enable GPU (same as Session 2)
3. Verify GPU availability

### Test Execution Checklist (10-15 min)

#### ✅ Cell 1-2: Setup & Imports
- [ ] Packages install: `tensorflow-hub`, `pycocotools`
- [ ] All imports successful
- [ ] TensorFlow and TF Hub load correctly

---

#### ✅ Cell 3-5: Demo Data Generation
- [ ] Urban image generation starts
- [ ] 60 images generated (~30 seconds)
- [ ] Buildings visible as bright rectangles
- [ ] Dataset split: 42 train, 9 val, 9 test

**Expected Output:**
```
Train: 42, Val: 9, Test: 9
```

---

#### ✅ Cell 6-7: Visualization
- [ ] 4 sample images display
- [ ] Red bounding boxes around buildings
- [ ] 3-8 buildings per image (varied)
- [ ] Image titles show building counts

---

#### ✅ Cell 8-9: Pre-trained Model Loading

- [ ] SSD MobileNet loads successfully
- [ ] Model type confirmed

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Pre-trained model loaded!
Pre-trained on COCO dataset (80 classes)
```

---

#### ✅ Cell 10: Inference Test
- [ ] Detection runs on test image
- [ ] Output contains detection_boxes, detection_scores, detection_classes
- [ ] No errors during inference

---

#### ✅ Cell 11-12: IoU Calculation & Evaluation
- [ ] IoU function works correctly
- [ ] Example IoU calculated (~0.1-0.4 range expected)
- [ ] No division by zero errors

---

#### ✅ Cell 13: Visualization
- [ ] Ground truth (green boxes) vs predictions (red boxes) displayed
- [ ] Confidence scores shown
- [ ] Threshold filtering works (default 0.3)
- [ ] Clear comparison between GT and predictions

**Quality Check:**
- Some predictions overlap with ground truth (shows model detects objects)
- Not perfect (expected, model not fine-tuned for buildings)

---

### Expected Performance Notes

**Pre-trained model (COCO) on synthetic buildings:**
- mAP: ~0.10-0.30 (not trained for satellite buildings)
- Some false positives expected
- **This is intentional** - demonstrates need for fine-tuning

**After fine-tuning (production):**
- mAP: 0.70-0.85
- Better building detection
- Fewer false positives

---

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue 1: TF Hub model download slow**
- **Normal:** First download takes 1-2 minutes
- **Solution:** Wait patiently, subsequent runs are instant

**Issue 2: No detections visible**
- **Solution:** Lower confidence threshold: `threshold=0.1` instead of 0.5
- **Edit:** In visualization cell

**Issue 3: Too many false detections**
- **Solution:** Raise threshold: `threshold=0.5` or 0.7
- **Expected:** Some false positives with pre-trained model

## 8. Known Limitations (Acceptable)

### Synthetic Data Limitations
✅ **Acceptable:** Synthetic data is simpler than real SAR/optical data
- Real SAR has more speckle noise
- Real buildings have more variety
- Real flood patterns more complex

**Mitigation:** DATA_GUIDE.md provides real data path

✅ **Acceptable:** Model performance on synthetic data ≠ real data performance
- Synthetic: IoU ~0.75-0.85
- Real: May be 0.60-0.75 initially

**Mitigation:** Clear educational notes in notebooks

✅ **Acceptable:** No actual fine-tuning in Session 4
- Full fine-tuning requires TF Object Detection API setup
- Simplified workflow demonstrates concept

**Mitigation:** Session 4 QMD page explains production approach
