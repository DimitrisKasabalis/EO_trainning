## Next Steps Recommended

### 1. Update Individual Day Landing Pages (Optional)
The main index is now accurate. Consider updating day landing pages to match:
- `day1/index.qmd` - Add "‚úÖ Production Ready" callout
- `day2/index.qmd` - Add "‚úÖ Production Ready" callout
- `day3/index.qmd` - Already shows partial status ‚úÖ
- `day4/index.qmd` - Add "‚úÖ Production Ready" callout

### 2. Render and Deploy
```bash
cd /Users/dimitriskasampalis/Projects/Neuralio/ESAPhil/course_site
quarto render
# Then deploy _site/ to hosting
```

### 3. Test User Flow
- Click through each "Complete" day to verify all links work
- Verify Day 3 shows appropriate "in development" messaging
- Test notebook download links

### 4. Announce to Stakeholders
**Email/Message Template:**
```
