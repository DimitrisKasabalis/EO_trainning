Session 1: Copernicus Sentinel Data Deep Dive & Philippine EO Ecosystem (2 hours)
○	Module: Copernicus Program Overview; Sentinel-1 & Sentinel-2: This module will provide a comprehensive overview of the Copernicus Earth Observation program, focusing on the Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (Optical) missions. Key data characteristics such as spectral bands, spatial resolutions (10m, 20m, 60m for Sentinel-2; up to 5m x 20m for Sentinel-1 IW mode), and temporal resolutions (5 days for S2, 6-12 days for S1 with constellation) will be detailed. Standard data products (e.g., Level-1C, Level-2A for Sentinel-2; GRD for Sentinel-1) and methods for accessing these data, including Copernicus Hubs and Google Earth Engine, will be thoroughly explained.
○	Module: The Philippine EO Landscape: This segment will introduce participants to the key national agencies and initiatives relevant to Earth Observation in the Philippines. This includes the Philippine Space Agency (PhilSA) and its data platforms like the Space+ Data Dashboard, the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority (NAMRIA) and its Geoportal providing access to basemaps, hazard maps, and land cover data, the Department of Science and Technology - Advanced Science and Technology Institute (DOST-ASTI) with projects like DATOS (Remote Sensing and Data Science Help Desk), SkAI-Pinas (Philippine Sky Artificial Intelligence Program), DIMER (Democratized Intelligent Model Exchange Repository), and AIPI (AI Processing Interface), and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) for climate and weather data. The discussion will highlight how locally available datasets can complement Sentinel data for richer AI/ML analysis. 
○	Activity: Introduction to CopPhil Mirror Site and Digital Space Campus: A brief overview of the CopPhil data repository (Mirror Site) and the Digital Space Campus will be provided, setting the stage for how training materials will be accessible for future use and contribute to national capacity building.

Session 2: Core Concepts of AI/ML for Earth Observation (2 hours)
○	Module: What is AI/ML? The AI/ML workflow in EO: This module will demystify AI and ML, outlining a typical workflow for EO applications. This workflow encompasses problem definition, data acquisition, crucial pre-processing steps, feature engineering, model selection and training, rigorous validation, and eventual deployment for operational use.
○	Module: Types of ML: Supervised (Classification, Regression), Unsupervised (Clustering) with EO examples: The main paradigms of machine learning will be introduced. Supervised learning, where models learn from labeled data, will be exemplified by tasks like land cover classification (assigning pixels to classes like 'forest' or 'water') and regression (predicting continuous values like 'biomass' or 'soil moisture'). Unsupervised learning, which finds patterns in unlabeled data, will be briefly touched upon with examples like image clustering.
○	Module: Introduction to Deep Learning: Neural Networks, basic concepts: Participants will be introduced to the foundational concepts of deep learning, including the structure of artificial neural networks (neurons, layers), activation functions (which introduce non-linearity), loss functions (which measure model error), and optimizers (which adjust model parameters to minimize error).
○	Module: Data-Centric AI in EO: Importance of data quality, quantity, diversity, and annotation: This module will emphasize that the success of AI/ML in Earth Observation is profoundly dependent on the data itself. The principles of Data-Centric AI will be introduced, highlighting the critical importance of high-quality, well-annotated, diverse, and voluminous datasets for training robust and reliable models. Given that EO data often presents challenges like noise, atmospheric interference, and label scarcity, a data-centric mindset is crucial for practitioners to avoid common pitfalls where models underperform due to data issues rather than inherent model flaws.

Session 3: Hands-on: Python for Geospatial Data (2 hours)
○	Platform: Google Colaboratory.
○	Module: Setting up Colab, Google Drive integration, installing packages: Practical guidance on navigating the Colab environment, mounting Google Drive for data access and storage, and installing necessary Python packages using pip.
○	Module: Python basics recap: A tailored recap of Python fundamentals (data types, control structures like loops, functions) will be provided, adjusted based on a pre-training assessment of participants' Python proficiency.
○	Hands-on: Loading, exploring, and visualizing vector data with GeoPandas: Participants will work with sample vector datasets, such as Philippine administrative boundaries or example Areas of Interest (AOIs), learning how to read, manipulate, and plot this data using the GeoPandas library.
○	Hands-on: Loading, exploring, and visualizing raster data with Rasterio and Matplotlib: This exercise will involve working with a small subset of a Sentinel-2 L2A tile. Participants will learn to open, inspect metadata, read pixel values, perform basic raster operations like cropping and resampling, and visualize the data using Rasterio and Matplotlib. A solid grasp of Python for handling both vector and raster data, as covered in this session, is a critical prerequisite. These skills form the bedrock upon which more complex AI/ML workflows will be built in subsequent days; any weakness here will likely impede understanding and progress in later modules.
○	
Session 4: Introduction to Google Earth Engine (GEE) for Data Access & Pre-processing (2 hours)
○	Platform: GEE Code Editor and GEE Python API within Google Colab.
○	Module: GEE Concepts: Image, ImageCollection, Feature, FeatureCollection, Filters, Reducers: Core GEE data structures and operations will be explained, enabling participants to understand how GEE handles and processes vast amounts of geospatial data efficiently.
○	Hands-on: Searching and accessing Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 collections in GEE: Participants will learn to query the GEE data catalog for Sentinel imagery, applying spatial and temporal filters to find relevant scenes for specific AOIs and time periods.
○	Hands-on: Basic pre-processing in GEE: Practical exercises will demonstrate common pre-processing tasks directly within GEE, such as cloud masking for Sentinel-2 imagery using the QA bands, creating temporal composites (e.g., median or mean composites over a time range to reduce cloud effects and noise), and clipping imagery to an AOI.
○	Module: Exporting data from GEE for use in external AI/ML workflows: A crucial skill is moving data from GEE to platforms like Colab for custom model training. This module will cover methods for exporting processed images or feature collections (e.g., training samples) to Google Drive or Cloud Storage. The early introduction to Colab best practices and a clear understanding of GEE's capabilities alongside its limitations for certain types of advanced AI/ML (e.g., training complex custom deep learning models natively) will set realistic expectations. This empowers users to troubleshoot common issues and plan their workflows effectively, contributing to the sustainable application of these skills."
