### 2.1. Lecture Materials

**AI/ML Concepts in Earth Observation:** This lecture segment introduces
how artificial intelligence and machine learning are applied to EO data,
covering key concepts and workflows:

- **AI/ML Workflow for EO:** A typical **machine learning workflow** in
  EO involves several stages. *Slides should illustrate:*
- **Problem Definition:** e.g., identifying what environmental question
  to answer (flood mapping? land cover classification? yield
  prediction).
- **Data Acquisition:** gathering relevant EO data (Sentinel images,
  ground truth labels, ancillary data).
- **Data Pre-processing:** crucial for EO (geometric corrections, cloud
  masking, normalization, etc.) before feeding data to models.
- **Feature Engineering:** deriving informative features (spectral
  indices like NDVI, textures, DEM derivatives) from raw data.
- **Model Selection & Training:** choosing an algorithm (e.g., Random
  Forest, CNN) and training it on labeled examples.
- **Validation & Evaluation:** using separate test data to assess
  accuracy (confusion matrix, error metrics).
- **Deployment:** applying the model to new data or integrating into
  workflows for operational use. This end-to-end process ensures that
  participants see the "big picture" of how AI/ML projects are executed
  for EO applications.
- **Types of ML -- Supervised vs Unsupervised:** Define the two main
  paradigms with EO examples. In **supervised learning**, the model
  learns from labeled data. EO examples: land cover classification
  (labels = classes like water, urban, forest for each pixel) and
  regression tasks (predicting a continuous value such as soil moisture
  or air pollutant concentration from satellite data). In **unsupervised
  learning**, the algorithm finds patterns without explicit labels.
  Example: clustering multispectral images to discover land cover groups
  or anomalies (useful for exploratory analysis or change detection).
  *Slides:* could show an illustration of labeled training pixels on a
  satellite image for supervised learning, versus an image segmented
  into clusters for unsupervised.
- **Neural Networks & Deep Learning Basics:** Briefly introduce that
  **deep learning** is a subset of ML using neural networks with many
  layers ("deep" networks) that excel at learning complex patterns. A
  slide can depict a simple **Artificial Neural Network** with neurons
  organized in layers (input layer → hidden layers → output). Explain
  key concepts in simple terms: neurons apply activation functions to
  weighted sums of inputs (introducing non-linearity), the network is
  trained by adjusting weights to minimize a loss function (error) using
  algorithms like gradient descent (optimizers). Emphasize how
  **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are specialized for images:
  using convolutional layers to automatically extract spatial features
  (edges, textures, objects) -- this will foreshadow Day 2 content. The
  point is to demystify terms like "layers", "activation", "training"
  for participants new to AI.
- **Data-Centric AI in EO:** "Data-centric AI" is the philosophy that
  improving your **data** (quality, quantity, diversity) is as important
  as model tuning. This is **especially critical in EO** where
  challenges like sensor noise, cloud cover, class imbalance, and label
  uncertainty can derail an AI project. Slides should stress that model
  performance in EO is often limited by the dataset: having
  well-annotated, representative training data (e.g. good ground truth
  for all land cover types, across different seasons and regions) is
  crucial. Mention strategies like augmenting training data, cleaning
  labels, and incorporating expert knowledge. The goal is to encourage
  participants to focus on creating or curating high-quality datasets
  for their projects, not just on choosing fancy algorithms. This aligns
  with CopPhil's capacity building -- ensuring participants can develop
  robust EO applications by paying attention to data suitability.
