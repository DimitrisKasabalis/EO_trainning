### 1.1. Lecture Materials

**Introduction to Copernicus in the Philippines:** The Copernicus
Capacity Support Programme for the Philippines (CopPhil) is a flagship
initiative under the EU's Global Gateway. It aims to increase the uptake
of free and open Copernicus Earth observation data in the Philippines,
strengthening the country's ability to address **disaster risk reduction
(DRR)**, **climate change adaptation (CCA)**, and *natural resource
management (NRM). This involves establishing a local Copernicus data
mirror site and co-developing pilot services, in partnership with the
Philippine Space Agency (PhilSA) and DOST (Department of Science and
Technology). Slide content:* Key points should include the
EU-Philippines space cooperation context, CopPhil goals (DRR, CCA, NRM),
and the roles of PhilSA and DOST in the programme.

**Copernicus Sentinel-1 & Sentinel-2 Overview:** Sentinel-1 and
Sentinel-2 are core satellites of the EU Copernicus program, providing
free high-resolution imagery. Sentinel-1 is a radar (SAR) mission with
**C-band synthetic aperture radar** enabling all-weather, day/night
imaging. With two satellites (1A & 1B, now 1C) orbiting 180° apart,
Sentinel-1 achieves a ~6-day revisit cycle globally. In its common
Interferometric Wide (IW) swath mode, Sentinel-1 has ~**5 m by 20 m**
spatial resolution (range × azimuth) and a 250 km swath. It provides
dual-polarization data (VV+VH or HH+HV) useful for mapping floods, land
deformation (InSAR), forest biomass, and maritime surveillance. Typical
products are Level-1 **GRD (Ground Range Detected)** images (multi-look
intensity) and SLC (Single Look Complex) images, which are all openly
accessible. Sentinel-2 is an optical mission carrying a **MultiSpectral
Instrument (MSI)** with **13 spectral bands** (visible, near-infrared,
and shortwave-infrared) at **10 m, 20 m, and 60 m** resolutions. Twin
satellites (2A & 2B) in sun-synchronous orbit provide a **5-day
revisit** for any location. Each Sentinel-2 scene covers a 100×100 km
tile. Important band characteristics: 10 m for RGB and NIR bands, 20 m
for red-edge and SWIR bands, 60 m for atmospheric bands. Slides should
list Sentinel-2's **Level-1C (Top-of-Atmosphere)** and **Level-2A
(Surface Reflectance)** products, and Sentinel-1's Level-1 GRD and SLC
products, along with data access methods (the new Copernicus Data Space
Ecosystem replacing the legacy Open Access Hub, and platforms like
Google Earth Engine). *Slide content:* comparisons of Sentinel-1 vs
Sentinel-2 (sensor type, spectral bands, spatial/temporal resolution,
example uses). Mention that Sentinel data can be retrieved via
Copernicus hubs (now the Data Space Ecosystem) or via cloud platforms
and APIs (e.g., ASF for Sentinel-1, and GEE).

*Example Sentinel-2 imagery of Mayon Volcano in the Philippines
(false-color composite highlighting the 2018 lava flows). Sentinel-2
provides multi-spectral optical data at 10--60 m resolution across 13
bands. With a 5-day revisit, it supports monitoring of dynamic
environmental events. (Contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data

**Philippine EO Data Ecosystem:** The Philippines has its own geospatial
data platforms that complement Copernicus data. Slides should introduce
the key agencies and tools:

- **PhilSA Space Data Dashboard (Space+ SDD):** PhilSA's online platform
  for **satellite data access and visualization**, built with
  open-source tools (TerriaJS, OpenDataCube, etc.). It provides
  government and citizens with easy access to satellite-derived
  datasets, including direct downloads of imagery for uses in disaster
  management, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. *Include:* a
  note that SDD democratizes EO data access in the country, aligning
  with sustainable development goals.
- **NAMRIA Geoportal:** Managed by the National Mapping and Resource
  Information Authority, this geoportal provides national **basemaps,
  topographic maps, land cover data, and hazard maps**. It allows users
  to view and download layers like the official 1:50k base maps,
  administrative boundaries, and thematic maps (e.g., 2020 land cover)
  for the Philippines. Emphasize its role in DRR (hazard map access) and
  in providing authoritative geospatial data.
- **DOST-ASTI Projects:** The Advanced Science and Technology Institute
  of DOST leads several EO and AI initiatives:
- **DATOS (Remote Sensing and Data Science Help Desk):** A project
  applying AI, machine learning, GIS and remote sensing for disaster
  mapping and other applications. For example, DATOS developed methods
  to automatically map floods from satellite images and to identify
  crops (like mapping sugarcane via temporal radar signatures). It
  essentially serves as a rapid analytics service during disasters.
- **SkAI-Pinas (Sky Artificial Intelligence Program):** A DOST flagship
  R&D program to **democratize AI in the Philippines** by building AI
  capacity in remote sensing. It focuses on making AI "part of daily
  decision-making and national progress". SkAI-Pinas supports the
  development of AI models and tools, including **DIMER** (Democratized
  Intelligent Model Exchange Repository) -- a repository for sharing
  pre-trained AI models, and **AIPI** (AI Processing Interface) -- a
  platform to streamline large-scale AI processing of geospatial data.
  These tools enable Filipino researchers and agencies to apply AI
  without needing big compute resources, by reusing models and an
  accessible processing interface.
- **Philippine Earth Data Resource Observation (PEDRO) Center:**
  (Related infrastructure, not in bullet but may be worth noting) --
  DOST-ASTI's satellite ground receiving station that acquires Diwata
  microsatellite data and other imagery, contributing local
  high-resolution data.
- **PAGASA and Other Data Sources:** The national meteorological agency
  PAGASA provides climate and weather data (e.g., typhoon tracks,
  rainfall) that can be integrated with satellite data for climate
  adaptation analysis. Also mention that the CopPhil program is setting
  up a **Copernicus Mirror Site** in-country to locally host Sentinel
  data for faster access, ensuring sustainable data availability for
  Philippine users.

*Slide content:* a diagram or list of the Philippine EO ecosystem,
showing how PhilSA, NAMRIA, DOST-ASTI (DATOS, SkAI-Pinas, DIMER, AIPI),
and PAGASA contribute data or tools. Highlight that these local datasets
(e.g. national base maps, hazard maps, local AI models) **complement
Sentinel imagery** to create richer insights. For example, during a
flood event, Sentinel-1 SAR can detect water extent, while NAMRIA flood
hazard maps and PAGASA rain gauges provide context -- together
supporting better DRR decisions.
