## Part 1: The Copernicus Programme

### What is Copernicus?

**Copernicus** is the European Union's flagship Earth Observation programme providing **free and open satellite data** for environmental monitoring and societal applications worldwide. It represents the world's largest single Earth observation programme, with a multi-billion euro investment.

::: {.callout-note}
## Why "Copernicus"?

Named after Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543), the Renaissance astronomer who formulated the heliocentric model of the universe. Just as Copernicus revolutionized our understanding of our place in the cosmos, the Copernicus programme transforms our understanding of Earth systems.
:::

### Copernicus Components

The programme consists of:

1. **Space Component** - The Sentinel satellite family (1-6)
2. **In Situ Component** - Ground-based and airborne observations
3. **Services** - Thematic information products:
   - Atmosphere Monitoring
   - Marine Environment Monitoring
   - Land Monitoring
   - Climate Change
   - Emergency Management
   - Security

### The Sentinel Family

| Sentinel | Type | Primary Application |
|----------|------|---------------------|
| **Sentinel-1** | C-band SAR | All-weather radar imaging |
| **Sentinel-2** | Multispectral Optical | Land monitoring |
| **Sentinel-3** | Ocean & Land | Marine/land surface monitoring |
| **Sentinel-4** | Geostationary | Air quality monitoring |
| **Sentinel-5P** | Atmospheric | Air quality and pollution |
| **Sentinel-6** | Radar Altimetry | Ocean surface topography |

**For this training**, we focus on **Sentinel-1** and **Sentinel-2** - the most widely used for DRR, CCA, and NRM applications.

## Part 2: Sentinel-1 - Synthetic Aperture Radar

### Mission Overview

::: {.satellite-badge}
Sentinel-1A (2014)
:::
::: {.satellite-badge}
Sentinel-1B (2016-2022)
:::
::: {.satellite-badge}
Sentinel-1C (2024)
:::

**Sentinel-1** is a **C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)** mission providing all-weather, day-and-night imaging capability.

### 2025 Constellation Status

- **Sentinel-1A:** Operational since April 2014
- **Sentinel-1B:** Operational 2016-2022 (anomaly ended operations)
- **Sentinel-1C:** **Launched December 2024, operational in 2025** - restoring dual-satellite coverage

::: {.callout-tip}
## Why SAR Matters for the Philippines

The Philippines experiences:

- Frequent cloud cover (tropical climate)
- Monsoon seasons with persistent rain
- Nighttime disasters (earthquakes, floods)

**SAR sees through clouds and operates at night** - critical for disaster response when optical satellites are blinded.
:::

### Key Specifications

| Parameter | Specification |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Sensor Type** | C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar |
| **Frequency** | 5.405 GHz |
| **Orbit** | Sun-synchronous, polar |
| **Altitude** | 693 km |
| **Revisit Time** | 6 days (two satellites), 12 days (single) |
| **Swath Width** | 250 km (IW mode) |
| **Spatial Resolution** | 5 m × 20 m (range × azimuth, IW mode) |
| **Polarization** | Dual (VV+VH or HH+HV) |

### Imaging Modes

Sentinel-1 operates in four acquisition modes:

1. **Interferometric Wide Swath (IW)** - Most common, 250 km swath, 5×20 m resolution
2. **Extra Wide Swath (EW)** - 400 km swath, maritime surveillance
3. **Strip Map (SM)** - 80 km swath, 5 m resolution
4. **Wave Mode (WV)** - Ocean wave spectra

**For land applications:** IW mode is standard.

### Data Products

- **Level-0** - Raw data
- **Level-1 SLC (Single Look Complex)** - Complex imagery, for interferometry
- **Level-1 GRD (Ground Range Detected)** - Multi-looked, detected, most common for analysis
- **Level-2 OCN** - Ocean geophysical products

::: {.callout-note}
## GRD vs SLC

**GRD (Ground Range Detected):**

- Multi-looked (speckle reduced)
- Real-valued (amplitude only)
- Projected to ground range
- Ready for most applications
- **Use for:** Change detection, flood mapping, land cover

**SLC (Single Look Complex):**

- Complex values (amplitude + phase)
- Single look (full speckle)
- Radar geometry
- Required for interferometry
- **Use for:** InSAR, ground deformation, coherence analysis
:::

### Sentinel-1 Applications

**Disaster Risk Reduction:**

- Flood extent mapping
- Earthquake damage assessment (coherence change)
- Landslide detection

**Natural Resource Management:**

- Rice paddy mapping
- Mangrove extent monitoring

**Maritime:**

### Example: Sentinel-1 Flood Mapping

SAR backscatter characteristics:

- **Water:** Low backscatter (smooth surface) → **dark**
- **Urban:** High backscatter (corner reflectors) → **bright**
- **Vegetation:** Moderate backscatter (volume scattering)

During floods:

1. Normally bright agricultural land becomes dark (covered by water)
2. Compare pre-flood and flood images
3. Threshold or classify to extract flood extent
4. Deliver maps within hours of satellite overpass
