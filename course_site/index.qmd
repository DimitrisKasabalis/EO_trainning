# CopPhil EO AI/ML Training - Day 1

### Earth Observation Data, AI/ML Fundamentals & Geospatial Python

Advanced training for Philippine EO professionals on AI/ML applications for Disaster Risk Reduction, Climate Change Adaptation, and Natural Resource Management
:::

## About This Training

Welcome to Day 1 of the **4-Day Advanced Online Training on AI/ML for Earth Observation** for Philippine EO Professionals. This training is part of the **CopPhil Programme** (EU-Philippines Copernicus Capacity Support Programme), a flagship initiative under the European Union's Global Gateway strategy.

::: {.callout-note}
## Training Context

This course strengthens the Philippines' capacity to use Copernicus Earth Observation data for:

- **Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR)** - Flood mapping, typhoon monitoring, landslide assessment
- **Climate Change Adaptation (CCA)** - Drought monitoring, agricultural resilience, coastal changes
- **Natural Resource Management (NRM)** - Forest monitoring, land cover mapping, marine resources
:::

## Day 1 Overview

Day 1 provides the foundation for your AI/ML journey in Earth Observation. By the end of today, you will:

- Understand the Copernicus Sentinel missions and 2025 updates (Sentinel-2C, Sentinel-1C)
- Navigate the Philippine EO ecosystem (PhilSA, NAMRIA, DOST-ASTI)
- Grasp core AI/ML concepts and workflows for EO applications
- Handle geospatial data with Python (GeoPandas, Rasterio)
- Access and preprocess satellite data using Google Earth Engine
