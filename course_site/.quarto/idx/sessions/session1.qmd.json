{"title":"Learning Objectives","markdown":{"headingText":"Learning Objectives","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nBy the end of this session, you will be able to:\n\n*   **Describe** the Copernicus program and its goals in the Philippines.\n*   **Differentiate** between Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 missions and their key characteristics.\n*   **Identify** key Philippine agencies and platforms for Earth observation data.\n*   **Explain** how local and international EO data can be used together.\n\n### 1.1. Lecture Materials\n\n**Introduction to Copernicus in the Philippines:** The Copernicus\nCapacity Support Programme for the Philippines (CopPhil) is a flagship\ninitiative under the EU's Global Gateway. It aims to increase the uptake\nof free and open Copernicus Earth observation data in the Philippines,\nstrengthening the country's ability to address **disaster risk reduction\n(DRR)**, **climate change adaptation (CCA)**, and *natural resource\nmanagement (NRM). This involves establishing a local Copernicus data\nmirror site and co-developing pilot services, in partnership with the\nPhilippine Space Agency (PhilSA) and DOST (Department of Science and\nTechnology). Slide content:* Key points should include the\nEU-Philippines space cooperation context, CopPhil goals (DRR, CCA, NRM),\nand the roles of PhilSA and DOST in the programme.\n\n**Copernicus Sentinel-1 & Sentinel-2 Overview:** Sentinel-1 and\nSentinel-2 are core satellites of the EU Copernicus program, providing\nfree high-resolution imagery. Sentinel-1 is a radar (SAR) mission with\n**C-band synthetic aperture radar** enabling all-weather, day/night\nimaging. With two satellites (1A & 1B, now 1C) orbiting 180° apart,\nSentinel-1 achieves a ~6-day revisit cycle globally. In its common\nInterferometric Wide (IW) swath mode, Sentinel-1 has ~**5 m by 20 m**\nspatial resolution (range × azimuth) and a 250 km swath. It provides\ndual-polarization data (VV+VH or HH+HV) useful for mapping floods, land\ndeformation (InSAR), forest biomass, and maritime surveillance. Typical\nproducts are Level-1 **GRD (Ground Range Detected)** images (multi-look\nintensity) and SLC (Single Look Complex) images, which are all openly\naccessible. Sentinel-2 is an optical mission carrying a **MultiSpectral\nInstrument (MSI)** with **13 spectral bands** (visible, near-infrared,\nand shortwave-infrared) at **10 m, 20 m, and 60 m** resolutions. Twin\nsatellites (2A & 2B) in sun-synchronous orbit provide a **5-day\nrevisit** for any location. Each Sentinel-2 scene covers a 100×100 km\ntile. Important band characteristics: 10 m for RGB and NIR bands, 20 m\nfor red-edge and SWIR bands, 60 m for atmospheric bands. Slides should\nlist Sentinel-2's **Level-1C (Top-of-Atmosphere)** and **Level-2A\n(Surface Reflectance)** products, and Sentinel-1's Level-1 GRD and SLC\nproducts, along with data access methods (the new Copernicus Data Space\nEcosystem replacing the legacy Open Access Hub, and platforms like\nGoogle Earth Engine). *Slide content:* comparisons of Sentinel-1 vs\nSentinel-2 (sensor type, spectral bands, spatial/temporal resolution,\nexample uses). Mention that Sentinel data can be retrieved via\nCopernicus hubs (now the Data Space Ecosystem) or via cloud platforms\nand APIs (e.g., ASF for Sentinel-1, and GEE).\n\n*Example Sentinel-2 imagery of Mayon Volcano in the Philippines\n(false-color composite highlighting the 2018 lava flows). Sentinel-2\nprovides multi-spectral optical data at 10--60 m resolution across 13\nbands. With a 5-day revisit, it supports monitoring of dynamic\nenvironmental events. (Contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data\n[2018] processed by Pierre\nMarkuse[[1]](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mount_Mayon_Sentinel-2_L1C_from_2018-01-30_(28280091769).jpg#:~:text=))*\n\n**Philippine EO Data Ecosystem:** The Philippines has its own geospatial\ndata platforms that complement Copernicus data. Slides should introduce\nthe key agencies and tools:\n\n- **PhilSA Space Data Dashboard (Space+ SDD):** PhilSA's online platform\n  for **satellite data access and visualization**, built with\n  open-source tools (TerriaJS, OpenDataCube, etc.). It provides\n  government and citizens with easy access to satellite-derived\n  datasets, including direct downloads of imagery for uses in disaster\n  management, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. *Include:* a\n  note that SDD democratizes EO data access in the country, aligning\n  with sustainable development goals.\n- **NAMRIA Geoportal:** Managed by the National Mapping and Resource\n  Information Authority, this geoportal provides national **basemaps,\n  topographic maps, land cover data, and hazard maps**. It allows users\n  to view and download layers like the official 1:50k base maps,\n  administrative boundaries, and thematic maps (e.g., 2020 land cover)\n  for the Philippines. Emphasize its role in DRR (hazard map access) and\n  in providing authoritative geospatial data.\n- **DOST-ASTI Projects:** The Advanced Science and Technology Institute\n  of DOST leads several EO and AI initiatives:\n- **DATOS (Remote Sensing and Data Science Help Desk):** A project\n  applying AI, machine learning, GIS and remote sensing for disaster\n  mapping and other applications. For example, DATOS developed methods\n  to automatically map floods from satellite images and to identify\n  crops (like mapping sugarcane via temporal radar signatures). It\n  essentially serves as a rapid analytics service during disasters.\n- **SkAI-Pinas (Sky Artificial Intelligence Program):** A DOST flagship\n  R&D program to **democratize AI in the Philippines** by building AI\n  capacity in remote sensing. It focuses on making AI \"part of daily\n  decision-making and national progress\". SkAI-Pinas supports the\n  development of AI models and tools, including **DIMER** (Democratized\n  Intelligent Model Exchange Repository) -- a repository for sharing\n  pre-trained AI models, and **AIPI** (AI Processing Interface) -- a\n  platform to streamline large-scale AI processing of geospatial data.\n  These tools enable Filipino researchers and agencies to apply AI\n  without needing big compute resources, by reusing models and an\n  accessible processing interface.\n- **Philippine Earth Data Resource Observation (PEDRO) Center:**\n  (Related infrastructure, not in bullet but may be worth noting) --\n  DOST-ASTI's satellite ground receiving station that acquires Diwata\n  microsatellite data and other imagery, contributing local\n  high-resolution data.\n- **PAGASA and Other Data Sources:** The national meteorological agency\n  PAGASA provides climate and weather data (e.g., typhoon tracks,\n  rainfall) that can be integrated with satellite data for climate\n  adaptation analysis. Also mention that the CopPhil program is setting\n  up a **Copernicus Mirror Site** in-country to locally host Sentinel\n  data for faster access, ensuring sustainable data availability for\n  Philippine users.\n\n*Slide content:* a diagram or list of the Philippine EO ecosystem,\nshowing how PhilSA, NAMRIA, DOST-ASTI (DATOS, SkAI-Pinas, DIMER, AIPI),\nand PAGASA contribute data or tools. Highlight that these local datasets\n(e.g. national base maps, hazard maps, local AI models) **complement\nSentinel imagery** to create richer insights. For example, during a\nflood event, Sentinel-1 SAR can detect water extent, while NAMRIA flood\nhazard maps and PAGASA rain gauges provide context -- together\nsupporting better DRR decisions.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":true,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":false,"code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":true,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":true,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":true,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["include-code-files"],"css":["../styles/custom.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"number-sections":false,"output-file":"session1.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Contents","toc-title-website":"On
