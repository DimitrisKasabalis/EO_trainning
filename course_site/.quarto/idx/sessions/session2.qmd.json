Lecture Materials\n\n**AI/ML Concepts in Earth Observation:** This lecture segment introduces\nhow artificial intelligence and machine learning are applied to EO data,\ncovering key concepts and workflows:\n\n- **AI/ML Workflow for EO:** A typical **machine learning workflow** in\n  EO involves several stages. *Slides should illustrate:*\n- **Problem Definition:** e.g., identifying what environmental question\n  to answer (flood mapping? land cover classification? yield\n  prediction).\n- **Data Acquisition:** gathering relevant EO data (Sentinel images,\n  ground truth labels, ancillary data).\n- **Data Pre-processing:** crucial for EO (geometric corrections, cloud\n  masking, normalization, etc.) before feeding data to models.\n- **Feature Engineering:** deriving informative features (spectral\n  indices like NDVI, textures, DEM derivatives) from raw data.\n- **Model Selection & Training:** choosing an algorithm (e.g., Random\n  Forest, CNN) and training it on labeled examples.\n- **Validation & Evaluation:** using separate test data to assess\n  accuracy (confusion matrix, error metrics).\n- **Deployment:** applying the model to new data or integrating into\n  workflows for operational use. This end-to-end process ensures that\n  participants see the \"big picture\" of how AI/ML projects are executed\n  for EO applications.\n- **Types of ML -- Supervised vs Unsupervised:** Define the two main\n  paradigms with EO examples. In **supervised learning**, the model\n  learns from labeled data. EO examples: land cover classification\n  (labels = classes like water, urban, forest for each pixel) and\n  regression tasks (predicting a continuous value such as soil moisture\n  or air pollutant concentration from satellite data). In **unsupervised\n  learning**, the algorithm finds patterns without explicit labels.\n  Example: clustering multispectral images to discover land cover groups\n  or anomalies (useful for exploratory analysis or change detection).\n  *Slides:* could show an illustration of labeled training pixels on a\n  satellite image for supervised learning, versus an image segmented\n  into clusters for unsupervised.\n- **Neural Networks & Deep Learning Basics:** Briefly introduce that\n  **deep learning** is a subset of ML using neural networks with many\n  layers (\"deep\" networks) that excel at learning complex patterns. A\n  slide can depict a simple **Artificial Neural Network** with neurons\n  organized in layers (input layer → hidden layers → output). Explain\n  key concepts in simple terms: neurons apply activation functions to\n  weighted sums of inputs (introducing non-linearity), the network is\n  trained by adjusting weights to minimize a loss function (error) using\n  algorithms like gradient descent (optimizers). Emphasize how\n  **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are specialized for images:\n  using convolutional layers to automatically extract spatial features\n  (edges, textures, objects) -- this will foreshadow Day 2 content. The\n  point is to demystify terms like \"layers\", \"activation\", \"training\"\n  for participants new to AI.\n- **Data-Centric AI in EO:** \"Data-centric AI\" is the philosophy that\n  improving your **data** (quality, quantity, diversity) is as important\n  as model tuning. This is **especially critical in EO** where\n  challenges like sensor noise, cloud cover, class imbalance, and label\n  uncertainty can derail an AI project. Slides should stress that model\n  performance in EO is often limited by the dataset: having\n  well-annotated, representative training data (e.g. good ground truth\n  for all land cover types, across different seasons and regions) is\n  crucial. Mention strategies like augmenting training data, cleaning\n  labels, and incorporating expert knowledge. The goal is to encourage\n  participants to focus on creating or curating high-quality datasets\n  for their projects, not just on choosing fancy algorithms. This aligns\n  with CopPhil's capacity building -- ensuring participants can develop\n  robust EO applications by paying attention to data suitability.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":true,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":false,"code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":true,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":true,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":true,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["include-code-files"],"css":["../styles/custom.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"number-sections":false,"output-file":"session2.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Contents","toc-title-website":"On
