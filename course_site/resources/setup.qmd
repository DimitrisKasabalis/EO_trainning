## Welcome

This guide will help you set up everything you need for the CopPhil EO AI/ML Training. All exercises run in Google Colaboratory, so you won't need to install Python or libraries on your local machine.

::: {.callout-note}
## Time Required
Allow **15-20 minutes** to complete all setup steps before Day 1 begins.
:::

## Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting the training, ensure you have:

::: {.prerequisites-checklist}
- [ ] A Google account (Gmail)
- [ ] Google Earth Engine access (registration required)
- [ ] Stable internet connection (minimum 5 Mbps recommended)
- [ ] Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- [ ] Headphones/speakers for audio
:::

## Step 1: Google Account Setup

### 1.1 Create or Verify Google Account

You need a Google account to access Google Colaboratory and Google Earth Engine.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Already Have Gmail?
If you have a Gmail account, you're all set! Skip to Step 2.
:::

**To create a new account:**

1. Go to [accounts.google.com](https://accounts.google.com)
2. Click **"Create account"**
3. Follow the registration process
4. Verify your email address

---

## Step 2: Google Colaboratory Setup

### 2.1 What is Google Colab?

Google Colaboratory (Colab) is a free cloud service that lets you write and execute Python code in your browser. It provides:

- Free access to GPUs (Graphics Processing Units)
- Pre-installed Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.)
- Cloud storage integration with Google Drive
- Shareable notebooks

### 2.2 Access Google Colab

1. Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. You'll see the welcome screen with example notebooks

### 2.3 Test Your Colab Setup

Let's verify everything works:

1. **Create a new notebook:**
   - Click **"File" → "New notebook"**
   - A new notebook opens with an empty code cell

2. **Run a test:**
   - Copy and paste this code into the first cell:

   ```python
   import sys
   print(f"Python version: {sys.version}")
   print("Google Colab is working!")
   ```

   - Press **Shift + Enter** to run the cell
   - You should see the Python version and success message

3. **Test package installation:**

   ```python
   # Test common geospatial packages
   import numpy as np
   import pandas as pd
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   print("✓ NumPy:", np.__version__)
   print("✓ Pandas:", pd.__version__)
   print("✓ Matplotlib:", plt.matplotlib.__version__)
   ```

::: {.callout-warning}
## First Run Takes Longer
The first time you run code in a new Colab session, it may take 30-60 seconds to allocate resources. This is normal.
:::

## Step 3: Google Earth Engine Registration

### 3.1 What is Google Earth Engine?

Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a cloud platform for planetary-scale geospatial analysis. It provides:

- Access to **petabytes** of satellite imagery (Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS, etc.)
- Cloud-based processing (no downloads needed)
- Python and JavaScript APIs
- Fast analysis over large areas and time periods

### 3.2 Register for Earth Engine

::: {.callout-important}
## Registration Required
Earth Engine registration can take **24-48 hours** for approval. Register well before the training starts!
:::

**Registration steps:**

1. **Go to:** [earthengine.google.com](https://earthengine.google.com)

2. **Click "Get Started"** or **"Sign Up"**

3. **Sign in** with your Google account

4. **Choose account type:**
   - Select **"Register a Noncommercial or Commercial Cloud project"**
   - For this training, select **"Noncommercial"** if applicable

5. **Complete the registration form:**
   - **Project type:** Education/Research
   - **Organization:** Your institution (e.g., "DOST-ASTI", "NAMRIA", "University of the Philippines")
   - **Project description:** "CopPhil EO AI/ML Training - Earth Observation data analysis for DRR/CCA/NRM applications"
   - **Intended use:** Describe your interest in using EO data

6. **Submit and wait for approval**
   - You'll receive an email when approved (usually within 24-48 hours)
   - Check your spam folder if you don't see the approval email

### 3.3 Verify Earth Engine Access

Once approved, test your access:

1. **Open Google Colab:** [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)

2. **Create a new notebook**

3. **Authenticate Earth Engine:**

```python
# Install Earth Engine API (if needed)
!pip install earthengine-api --quiet

# Import and authenticate
import ee

# Authenticate (first time only)
ee.Authenticate()

# Initialize Earth Engine
ee.Initialize()

# Test: Get an image
image = ee.Image('COPERNICUS/S2/20230101T000000_20230101T000000_T48PYS')
print("✓ Earth Engine is working!")
print(f"Image ID: {image.id().getInfo()}")
```

4. **Follow authentication prompts:**
   - Click the link that appears
   - Sign in with your Google account
   - Copy the authorization code
   - Paste it back into Colab

::: {.callout-tip}
## Authentication Only Once
After the first authentication, Earth Engine will remember your credentials in future Colab sessions.
:::

## Step 4: Install Geospatial Python Packages

In Google Colab, most packages are pre-installed. For specialized geospatial libraries, we'll install them when needed.

### Common packages we'll use:

| Package | Purpose | Pre-installed? |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| `numpy` | Numerical computing | Yes ✓ |
| `pandas` | Data manipulation | Yes ✓ |
| `matplotlib` | Visualization | Yes ✓ |
| `geopandas` | Vector data | **No** (we'll install) |
| `rasterio` | Raster data | **No** (we'll install) |
| `earthengine-api` | Google Earth Engine | **No** (we'll install) |
| `folium` | Interactive maps | Yes ✓ |

### Installation template for notebooks:

Each training notebook will include installation cells like this:

```python
# Install geospatial packages
!pip install geopandas rasterio earthengine-api --quiet

# Import packages
import geopandas as gpd
import rasterio
import ee

print("✓ All packages installed successfully!")
```

## Step 5: Google Drive Integration (Optional)

To save your work and access datasets, you can mount Google Drive in Colab:

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

**Benefits:**
- Save notebooks directly to Drive
- Access datasets stored in Drive
- Work persists between sessions

::: {.callout-note}
## Storage Limits
Free Google accounts get 15 GB of Drive storage. For large datasets, we'll stream data directly from Earth Engine instead.
:::

---

## Step 6: Download Training Notebooks

All training notebooks will be provided during the sessions. You can:

1. **Access via shared links** (provided by instructors)
2. **Download from the training portal** (see [Downloads](downloads.qmd))
3. **Clone from GitHub** (if repository is available)

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Runtime disconnected" in Colab

**Cause:** Colab sessions timeout after 90 minutes of inactivity (12 hours maximum)

**Solution:**
- Reconnect by clicking **"Reconnect"** button
- Re-run setup cells (imports, authentication)
- Consider using Colab Pro for longer sessions

### Issue 2: Earth Engine authentication fails

**Cause:** Not registered or registration not approved

**Solution:**
- Verify registration status at [earthengine.google.com](https://earthengine.google.com)
- Wait for approval email (24-48 hours)
- Check spam folder for approval notification

### Issue 3: Package installation fails

**Cause:** Network issues or package conflicts

**Solution:**
```python
# Force reinstall
!pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall geopandas

# Or use specific versions
!pip install geopandas==0.14.0
```

### Issue 4: Slow performance in Colab

**Cause:** Limited free resources

**Solutions:**
- Close other browser tabs
- Restart runtime: **Runtime → Restart runtime**
- Use GPU acceleration: **Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU**
- Reduce data processing scope

### Issue 5: Cannot access Google Drive

**Cause:** Permission not granted

**Solution:**
- Re-run the mount command
- Click the authorization link
- Grant access to Google Drive
