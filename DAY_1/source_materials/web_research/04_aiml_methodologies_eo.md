## Model Evaluation Metrics

### Overview

Proper evaluation of Earth Observation models is essential to assess performance, compare approaches, and ensure reliability in operational applications. Choice of metrics depends on task type (classification, regression, segmentation), class distribution, and application-specific costs of errors.

### Classification Metrics

#### Confusion Matrix Foundation

The confusion matrix is the foundation for most classification metrics:

|                | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |
|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Actual Positive** | True Positive (TP) | False Negative (FN) |
| **Actual Negative** | False Positive (FP) | True Negative (TN) |

#### Core Classification Metrics

**1. Accuracy**:
- **Formula**: (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
- **Definition**: Proportion of correct predictions
- **Range**: 0 to 1 (higher is better)
- **Limitation**: Misleading for imbalanced datasets
- **Example**: 99% accuracy means little if minority class is 1% of data

**2. Precision (Positive Predictive Value)**:
- **Formula**: TP / (TP + FP)
- **Question Answered**: Of all positive predictions, how many are correct?
- **Use Case**: When false positives are costly (e.g., alerting to non-existent floods)
- **Range**: 0 to 1

**3. Recall (Sensitivity, True Positive Rate)**:
- **Formula**: TP / (TP + FN)
- **Question Answered**: Of all actual positives, how many did we detect?
- **Use Case**: When false negatives are costly (e.g., missing deforestation)
- **Range**: 0 to 1

**4. F1 Score**:
- **Formula**: 2 Ã (Precision Ã Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
- **Definition**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Purpose**: Balances precision and recall in single metric
- **Best Use**: Class-imbalanced datasets, when both precision and recall matter
- **Range**: 0 to 1 (1 is perfect)

**5. F-Beta Score**:
- **Formula**: (1 + Î²Â²) Ã (Precision Ã Recall) / (Î²Â² Ã Precision + Recall)
- **Purpose**: Weighted harmonic mean favoring precision (Î² < 1) or recall (Î² > 1)
- **Applications**: Adjust Î² based on relative importance of precision vs. recall

#### Multi-Class Metrics

**1. Overall Accuracy (OA)**:
- Proportion of correctly classified pixels across all classes
- Most commonly reported metric in land cover classification

**2. Per-Class Metrics**:
- **Producer's Accuracy**: Recall for each class
- **User's Accuracy**: Precision for each class
- Important for understanding class-specific performance

**3. Macro vs. Micro Averaging**:
- **Macro-average**: Average metrics across classes (treats all classes equally)
- **Micro-average**: Aggregate TP, FP, FN globally (favors common classes)
- **Weighted-average**: Weights by class frequency

**4. Kappa Coefficient (Cohen's Kappa)**:
- **Formula**: (Po - Pe) / (1 - Pe)
- Po: Observed agreement
- Pe: Expected agreement by chance
- Accounts for agreement by chance
- Range: -1 to 1 (>0.8 considered excellent)

#### Advanced Classification Metrics

**1. AUC-ROC (Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic)**:
- Plots True Positive Rate vs. False Positive Rate across thresholds
- Measures discriminative ability independent of threshold
- Range: 0.5 (random) to 1.0 (perfect)
- **Best Use**: Evaluating probabilistic classifiers, comparing models

**2. AUC-PR (Area Under Precision-Recall Curve)**:
- Plots Precision vs. Recall across thresholds
- More informative than AUC-ROC for imbalanced datasets
- Focuses on positive class performance

**3. Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)**:
- **Formula**: (TPÃTN - FPÃFN) / sqrt((TP+FP)(TP+FN)(TN+FP)(TN+FN))
- Balanced measure even for imbalanced classes
- Range: -1 to 1

### Semantic Segmentation Metrics

#### Intersection over Union (IoU)

**Formula**: IoU = (Area of Overlap) / (Area of Union) = TP / (TP + FP + FN)

**Also Known As**: Jaccard Index

**Characteristics**:
- Measures spatial overlap between prediction and ground truth
- Penalizes both under-segmentation (false negatives) and over-segmentation (false positives)
- Range: 0 to 1

**Variants**:
- **Per-Class IoU**: Computed separately for each class
- **Mean IoU (mIoU)**: Average IoU across all classes
- **Weighted IoU**: Weights classes by frequency or importance

**Thresholds**:
- IoU > 0.5: Generally considered acceptable detection
- IoU > 0.7: High-quality segmentation
- IoU > 0.9: Excellent agreement

**Applications**: Land cover segmentation, building extraction, road network mapping

#### Dice Coefficient

**Formula**: Dice = 2ÃTP / (2ÃTP + FP + FN) = 2 Ã (Area of Overlap) / (Combined Area)

**Also Known As**: F1 Score for segmentation, SÃ¸rensenâDice index

**Relationship to IoU**: Dice = 2ÃIoU / (1 + IoU)

**Characteristics**:
- More weight on true positives than IoU
- Less harsh penalty for small discrepancies
- Range: 0 to 1

**Comparison to IoU**:
- Dice is less strict than IoU
- IoU penalizes under/over-segmentation more heavily
- Both are monotonically related; which to use is often application-dependent

**Why Dice Over IoU?**:
- Often used as loss function (differentiable)
- More balanced for small objects
- Historically popular in medical imaging, now adopted in EO

#### Pixel Accuracy

**Formula**: (TP + TN) / Total Pixels

**Limitations**:
- Biased toward majority class
- Can be misleading for imbalanced segmentation (e.g., rare objects)
- Often reported alongside IoU/Dice but less informative

#### Boundary Metrics

**Boundary F1 Score**:
- Precision and recall computed on boundary pixels
- Evaluates accuracy of object edges
- Important for applications requiring precise boundaries (e.g., cadastral mapping)

**Hausdorff Distance**:
- Maximum distance from predicted to ground truth boundary
- Measures worst-case boundary error
- Sensitive to outliers

### Regression Metrics

#### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

**Formula**: MAE = (1/n) Ã Î£|yi - Å·i|

**Characteristics**:
- Average absolute difference between predicted and actual
- Interpretable in original units
- Less sensitive to outliers than MSE

**Applications**: Biomass estimation, yield prediction, precipitation forecasting

#### Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RMSE

**MSE Formula**: MSE = (1/n) Ã Î£(yi - Å·i)Â²

**RMSE Formula**: RMSE = sqrt(MSE)

**Characteristics**:
- Penalizes large errors more heavily (squared term)
- RMSE in same units as target variable
- Common choice for regression optimization

#### RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination)

**Formula**: RÂ² = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot)

**Range**: -â to 1 (1 is perfect, 0 means model is no better than mean)

**Interpretation**:
- Proportion of variance explained by model
- RÂ² = 0.88 means model explains 88% of variance

**Limitations**: Can be misleading for non-linear relationships or biased models

### Choosing the Right Metric

#### Imbalanced Datasets

**Problem**: Accuracy can be misleading when classes are imbalanced.

**Solutions**:
- Use F1 Score, Precision-Recall AUC, or MCC
- Report per-class metrics
- Apply class weights or resampling

**Example**: In a dataset with 95% non-forest, a model predicting "non-forest" everywhere achieves 95% accuracy but 0% recall for forest class.

#### Application-Specific Costs

**High Cost of False Negatives** (e.g., disease detection, disaster mapping):
- Prioritize **Recall**
- Use F2 score (weights recall higher)

**High Cost of False Positives** (e.g., false alarms, unnecessary interventions):
- Prioritize **Precision**
- Use F0.5 score (weights precision higher)

**Balanced Cost**:
- Use **F1 Score** or **AUC-ROC**

#### Spatial Context

**Earth Observation Specifics**:
- **Spatial autocorrelation**: Nearby pixels are similar; standard metrics may overestimate performance if train/test sets are spatially proximate
- **Boundary uncertainty**: Mixed pixels at class boundaries can inflate error; boundary relaxation may be appropriate
- **Scale effects**: Metrics can vary with spatial resolution

**Validation Strategy**:
- Use spatial cross-validation to account for autocorrelation
- Report metrics at multiple spatial scales
- Consider buffer zones around objects

### Best Practices

1. **Report Multiple Metrics**: No single metric captures all aspects of model performance
2. **Confusion Matrix**: Always inspect confusion matrix to understand error patterns
3. **Class-Specific Metrics**: Report per-class precision, recall, and F1 for multi-class problems
4. **Validation Strategy**: Use appropriate cross-validation (spatial for EO)
5. **Baseline Comparison**: Compare to simple baselines (majority class, previous methods)
6. **Confidence Intervals**: Report uncertainty in metrics through bootstrapping or cross-validation
7. **Visual Inspection**: Qualitatively assess predictions on test images

- Use temporal composites (median, maximum NDVI) to reduce cloud impact
- Leverage multi-temporal data for gap-filling

**Recommendation**: Start with analysis-ready data (e.g., HLS, Sentinel-2 L2A) to reduce preprocessing complexity.

#### 2. Training Data

**Representative Sampling**:
- Ensure training samples cover the full range of spectral, spatial, and temporal variability
- Stratified sampling to balance classes
- Geographic diversity to improve generalization

**Label Accuracy**:
- Training data errors cause substantial errors in final predictions
- Use high-quality reference data (field surveys, high-resolution imagery)

- Use data augmentation and transfer learning to reduce requirements
- Consider active learning and weak supervision for label-efficient approaches

**Temporal Alignment**:
- Match ground-truth dates with satellite acquisition dates
- Account for phenological changes in multi-temporal datasets

#### 3. Spatial Validation

**Avoid Random Splits**:
- Random train-test splits violate independence assumption due to spatial autocorrelation
- Can lead to overoptimistic performance estimates (up to 28% overestimation)

**Use Spatial Cross-Validation**:
- Spatial k-fold: Divide data into spatially homogeneous clusters
- Buffered leave-one-out: Create buffer zones around test samples
- Spatial block CV: Ensure train and test sets are geographically separated

**Recommendation**: Always report validation strategy and consider spatial dependence when evaluating models.

#### 4. Model Selection and Training

**Start Simple**:
- Begin with baseline models (Random Forest, SVM) before deep learning
- Incrementally add complexity
- Compare to simple heuristics (NDVI thresholding)

**Transfer Learning**:
- Use pre-trained models (Prithvi, SatViT, ImageNet) when applicable
- Fine-tune on task-specific data
- Reduces training time and improves performance with limited data

**Hyperparameter Tuning**:
- Use systematic search (grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization)
- Optimize on validation set, not test set
- Monitor for overfitting

**Regularization**:
- Apply dropout, weight decay, or data augmentation
- Early stopping based on validation loss
- Ensemble multiple models for robustness

**Data Augmentation**:
- Rotation and flipping are particularly suitable for satellite imagery
- Color jittering simulates atmospheric variations
- Be cautious with transformations that change semantic meaning

#### 5. Feature Engineering

**Domain Knowledge**:
- Select spectral indices relevant to application (NDVI for vegetation, NDWI for water)
- Incorporate texture and temporal features
- Multi-modal fusion when appropriate (optical + SAR)

**Feature Importance Analysis**:
- Use tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost) to assess feature importance
- Remove redundant or low-importance features
- Balance between feature richness and model complexity

**Normalization**:
- Standardize or normalize features to comparable scales
- Per-band normalization for multi-spectral data
- Clip extreme values to reduce outlier impact

#### 6. Evaluation and Reporting

**Multiple Metrics**:
- Report accuracy, precision, recall, F1, IoU/Dice as appropriate
- Include confusion matrix for multi-class problems
- Per-class metrics to identify class-specific issues

**Error Analysis**:
- Investigate failure cases and misclassifications
- Identify systematic errors (e.g., confusion between similar classes)
- Use error analysis to guide data collection and model refinement

**Baseline Comparisons**:
- Compare to previous methods, simple heuristics, majority class baseline
- Report improvements clearly

**Reproducibility**:
- Share code, data, and trained models when possible
- Document hyperparameters, random seeds, software versions
- Use version control (Git) and experiment tracking (MLflow, Weights & Biases)

#### 7. Deployment and Monitoring

**Model Validation on Unseen Data**:
- Test on independent datasets from different geographic regions or time periods
- Assess generalization and robustness

**Continuous Monitoring**:
- Track model performance over time in operational settings
- Detect distribution shifts or degradation
- Retrain periodically with new data

**Interpretability**:
- Provide explanations for predictions (saliency maps, attention visualization)
- Builds trust in operational applications
- Aids in identifying model biases

### Common Pitfalls

#### 1. Spatial Autocorrelation Ignored

**Problem**: Using random train-test splits leads to spatial leakage, where test samples are too close to training samples.

**Consequence**: Overoptimistic performance estimates that don't reflect real-world generalization.

**Solution**: Implement spatial cross-validation strategies (spatial k-fold, buffered leave-one-out).

#### 2. Class Imbalance Not Addressed

**Problem**: Rare classes underrepresented in training data.

**Consequence**: Model biased toward majority classes, poor performance on minority classes.

**Solutions**:
- Resampling (oversample minority, undersample majority)
- Class weighting in loss function
- Use metrics like F1, Precision-Recall AUC instead of accuracy
- Data augmentation for minority classes

#### 3. Overfitting to Training Data

**Problem**: Model learns noise and specificities of training data rather than generalizable patterns.

**Consequence**: High training accuracy but poor test/real-world performance.

**Solutions**:
- Regularization (dropout, weight decay)
- Data augmentation
- Early stopping
- Larger and more diverse training set
- Simpler model architecture

**Detection**: Large gap between training and validation metrics.

#### 4. Insufficient or Poor-Quality Training Data

**Problem**: Too few samples or inaccurate labels.

**Consequence**: Model cannot learn robust representations, poor generalization.

**Solutions**:
- Invest in high-quality ground-truth collection
- Use active learning to prioritize labeling informative samples
- Apply weak supervision techniques
- Leverage transfer learning from pre-trained models

**Recommendation**: Data quality often matters more than data quantity.

#### 5. Ignoring Temporal Dynamics

**Problem**: Treating multi-temporal data as independent snapshots without considering temporal relationships.

**Consequence**: Missed opportunities to model phenology, seasonal patterns, and change detection.

**Solutions**:
- Use temporal features (statistics, trends)
- Apply temporal models (LSTM, temporal attention)
- Incorporate temporal embeddings in architectures

#### 6. Inconsistent Preprocessing

**Problem**: Different preprocessing applied to training and test data, or across time periods.

**Consequence**: Distribution shift, poor generalization.

**Solutions**:
- Standardize preprocessing pipeline
- Document and automate preprocessing steps
- Use consistent atmospheric correction and cloud masking

#### 7. Inappropriate Evaluation Metrics

**Problem**: Using accuracy for imbalanced datasets, or focusing solely on overall metrics without per-class analysis.

**Consequence**: Misleading assessment of model performance.

**Solutions**:
- Use metrics appropriate for data distribution and application (F1, IoU, Dice)
- Report per-class metrics
- Analyze confusion matrix

#### 8. Ignoring Computational and Operational Constraints

**Problem**: Developing complex models that are too slow or resource-intensive for deployment.

**Consequence**: Models that work in research but fail in operational settings.

**Solutions**:
- Consider inference time and memory requirements
- Optimize models for deployment (pruning, quantization)
- Balance accuracy with efficiency

#### 9. Not Accounting for Sensor Differences

**Problem**: Training on one sensor (e.g., Landsat) and deploying on another (e.g., Sentinel-2) without accounting for spectral differences.

**Consequence**: Performance degradation due to sensor-specific characteristics.

**Solutions**:
- Use harmonized datasets (HLS)
- Apply bandpass adjustment and normalization
- Train on multi-sensor data

#### 10. Lack of Explainability and Trust

**Problem**: Treating models as black boxes without understanding predictions.

**Consequence**: Difficulty diagnosing errors, lack of user trust, missed scientific insights.

**Solutions**:
