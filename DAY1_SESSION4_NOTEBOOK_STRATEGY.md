## 📖 Usage Guide for Instructors

### During Live Training:

**Session 4 Schedule (2 hours):**

**Hour 1: GEE Fundamentals (Notebook 1)**
- 0:00-0:15 - Setup, authentication (Section 1)
- 0:15-0:30 - Core concepts (Section 2)
- 0:30-0:50 - Sentinel-2 access, QA60 masking (Section 3)
- 0:50-1:00 - NDVI calculation, visualization

**Hour 2: Advanced Topics**
- 1:00-1:20 - Sentinel-1 SAR (continue Notebook 1)
- 1:20-1:40 - Export workflows (continue Notebook 1)
- 1:40-2:00 - **DEMO: SCL vs QA60 (Notebook 2)** ⭐

**Key Teaching Point:**
Show the **visual difference** between QA60 and SCL composites during the demo.
Explain: "This is why we use SCL for operational work."

### For Self-Paced Learners:

**Path 1: Comprehensive (Recommended)**
1. Complete Notebook 1 fully
2. Complete Notebook 2
3. Practice with own data

**Path 2: Quick Start (Experienced Users)**
1. Skim Notebook 1 sections 1-3
2. Focus on Notebook 2
3. Use as production template

**Path 3: Reference Only**
- Use notebooks as code reference
- Copy/adapt functions as needed

## ✨ P0 Improvement Alignment

### Expert Review Recommendation:
> "Use better cloud/shadow masking for Sentinel-2 (replace QA60)"
> "Switch to S2 Scene Classification Layer (SCL)"

### How We Addressed It:

1. ✅ **Notebook 1:** Teaches standard QA60 (foundation)
2. ✅ **Notebook 2:** Implements SCL (P0 improvement)
3. ✅ **Notebook 2:** Shows s2cloudless (advanced alternative)
4. ✅ **Visual comparison:** Demonstrates SCL superiority
5. ✅ **Clear guidance:** When to use which method

**Result:**
- Participants learn both approaches
- Understand WHY SCL is better
- Can apply appropriate method for their use case
- Have production-ready code templates

## 📝 Instructor Talking Points

### When Introducing Notebook 2:

> "In Notebook 1, we learned GEE using standard QA60 cloud masking. That's perfectly fine for learning and many applications.
>
> However, for operational work—land cover classification, NDVI time series, ML training data—we need better cloud masking.
>
> Notebook 2 shows you the P0 improvement: **Scene Classification Layer (SCL)**.
>
> Why is SCL better?
> - ✅ Detects cloud **shadows** (QA60 misses these!)
> - ✅ 12-class comprehensive classification
> - ✅ Cleaner composites for ML
>
> Let's see the difference..."
