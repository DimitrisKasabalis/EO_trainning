- **Wet Season** (Jul-Sep): Agricultural phenology
- **Change Metrics:** Inter-season differences

### Topographic Variables
- **Elevation:** Height above sea level
- **Slope:** Rate of elevation change
- **Aspect:** Slope direction
- **Hillshade:** Illumination simulation

## Instructor Notes

### Timing Tips
- Part A: Allow extra time for GLCM (computationally intensive)
- Part B: Most students finish in 40-50 minutes
- Part C: Can be shortened if time constrained
- Part D: Good for early finishers

### Common Questions
- "Why is GLCM slow?" ‚Üí Explain computational complexity
- "Can I use my own area?" ‚Üí Yes, provide coordinates
- "What if accuracy is low?" ‚Üí Review training data quality
- "How to export large areas?" ‚Üí Demonstrate tiling

### Teaching Strategies
- **Demo first:** Show complete workflow before exercises
- **Pair programming:** Partner students for troubleshooting
- **Live coding:** Walk through one feature type together
- **Gallery walk:** Share different parameter combinations
