   - Prepare Philippine EO examples (PhilSA Space+ Dashboard screenshots)

3. **Review Common Questions:**
   - "Why does CNN need so much more data?" → Explain parameter count
   - "Can I use CNNs with <500 samples?" → Transfer learning strategy
   - "Will my laptop work?" → No, use Colab (free GPU)
   - "How to adapt for Sentinel-2 10 bands?" → Session 4 covers this

4. **Set Up Q&A Tools:**
   - Virtual hands (Zoom reactions)
   - Shared document for questions
   - Breakout rooms for pair programming

### Timing Management

**Part A (15 min):**
