- **Code example** showing LSTM architecture
- **Expected results** (MAE < 0.05, 80%+ accuracy)
- **Clear call-to-action** to open student notebook

**Purpose:** Bridges theory and practice, gives students clear expectations

---

## 4. Added Mini-Challenge 1: Gradient Decay ✅

**Location:** After vanishing gradient explanation (line 264+)

### Content:
```markdown
🎯 Mini-Challenge 1: Calculate Gradient Decay

Task: Calculate how many time steps for gradient of 0.9 to shrink below 0.01
Formula: 0.9^n < 0.01
```

**Features:**
- Mathematical challenge
- Interactive <details> tag with answer reveal
- Practical interpretation for EO applications
- Shows why LSTMs are essential for long-term analysis

**Answer:** ~44 time steps (collapsible section)

---

## 5. Added Think-Through Discussion ✅

**Location:** After "Why LSTMs Solve Vanishing Gradients" (line 446+)

### Content:
```markdown
💭 Think-Through Discussion

Question: In drought monitoring, what might the forget gate discard 
vs. what might the input gate preserve?

Consider:
- Seasonal patterns vs. noise
- El Niño indicators
- Normal fluctuations vs. anomalies
```

**Purpose:** 
- Deepens understanding of LSTM gates
- Connects to Philippine drought context
- Encourages critical thinking about model behavior
