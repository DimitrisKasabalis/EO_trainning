## ⚠️ What's Missing (Gaps Identified)

### **1. EVALUATION METRICS FOR SEGMENTATION** 🔴 IMPORTANT

**What's Missing:**
The text you provided mentions: *"We'll also mention accuracy metrics for segmentation: besides IoU, metrics like Pixel Accuracy, Precision/Recall for a class, and F1-score can be computed to judge performance on a validation set."*

**Current Status:** 
- Evaluation metrics are **mentioned** in "Preparation for Session 2" (IoU, F1-score, precision, recall)
- But they are **not explained** in Session 1 itself

**Why This Matters:**
- Students need to understand how to **measure** segmentation performance
- Critical for **interpreting** results in Session 2 hands-on lab
- **Gap between training** (loss functions) and **evaluation** (metrics)

**Recommended Addition:**

Add a new section before "Key Takeaways":

```markdown
## Part 5: Evaluation Metrics for Segmentation

### How Do We Measure Performance?

Beyond the loss function used for training, we need metrics to evaluate how well our segmentation model performs on validation and test data.

### Common Segmentation Metrics

**1. Pixel Accuracy**
- **Definition:** Percentage of correctly classified pixels
- **Formula:** (Correctly Classified Pixels) / (Total Pixels)
- **Limitation:** Misleading for imbalanced datasets (e.g., 95% accuracy by predicting all background)

**2. Intersection over Union (IoU / Jaccard Index)**
- **Definition:** Overlap between prediction and ground truth
- **Formula:** IoU = (Intersection) / (Union)
- **Interpretation:** IoU = 1.0 (perfect), IoU > 0.5 (good), IoU < 0.3 (poor)
- **Use:** Standard metric for segmentation challenges

**3. Dice Coefficient (F1-Score)**
- **Definition:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Formula:** Dice = 2 × (Intersection) / (Sum of areas)
- **Related to IoU:** Dice = 2×IoU / (1 + IoU)
- **Use:** Common in medical imaging and EO

**4. Precision and Recall (Per-Class)**
- **Precision:** Of pixels predicted as class X, how many are correct?
  - Formula: TP / (TP + FP)
- **Recall:** Of actual class X pixels, how many did we find?
  - Formula: TP / (TP + FN)
- **Use:** Understand false positives vs false negatives

**5. F1-Score (Per-Class)**
- **Definition:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Formula:** 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
- **Use:** Balance between precision and recall

### Confusion Matrix for Segmentation

| | Predicted: Flood | Predicted: Non-Flood |
|---|---|---|
| **Actual: Flood** | True Positive (TP) | False Negative (FN) |
| **Actual: Non-Flood** | False Positive (FP) | True Negative (TN) |

### Which Metrics to Use?

**For Balanced Datasets:**
- Pixel Accuracy + IoU

**For Imbalanced Datasets (e.g., floods, ships):**
- IoU or Dice (class-specific)
- F1-Score for critical class
- Precision and Recall separately

**For Philippine Flood Mapping:**
- **Primary:** IoU for flood class (measures overlap)
- **Secondary:** Precision (avoid false alarms) and Recall (catch all floods)
- **Report:** Confusion matrix to understand error types
```

**Estimated Time to Add:** 10-15 minutes of session time  
**Placement:** After Part 4 (Loss Functions), before Key Takeaways  
**Length:** ~200-300 lines of content

---

### **2. INSTANCE SEGMENTATION vs SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION** 🟡 OPTIONAL

**What's Missing:**
- Brief mention of **instance segmentation** (distinguishing individual instances of same class)
- Difference between semantic segmentation (all buildings = one class) vs instance segmentation (building 1, building 2, building 3)

**Why This Matters:**
- Helps clarify what U-Net does vs doesn't do
- Relevant for Session 3 (Object Detection) comparison
- Common point of confusion

**Recommended Addition:**
A brief callout in Part 1:

```markdown
::: {.callout-note}
## Semantic vs Instance Segmentation

**Semantic Segmentation (what U-Net does):**
- All pixels of the same class get the same label
- Example: All buildings labeled as "building" (no distinction between individual buildings)

**Instance Segmentation (not covered in this session):**
- Each individual object instance gets a unique label
- Example: Building 1, Building 2, Building 3 as separate entities
- Architectures: Mask R-CNN, YOLOv8-seg

**For most EO applications, semantic segmentation is sufficient** (flood extent, land cover, crop types).
:::
```

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 minutes  
**Placement:** End of Part 1  
**Length:** ~15-20 lines

---

### **3. DATA AUGMENTATION FOR SEGMENTATION** 🟡 OPTIONAL

**What's Missing:**
- Brief mention of segmentation-specific data augmentation
- How to augment both image AND mask together

**Why This Matters:**
- Critical for training with limited data
- Common pitfall (augmenting image but not mask)
- Will be used in Session 2

**Recommended Addition:**
Add to Part 2 or Part 3:

```markdown
::: {.callout-tip}
## Data Augmentation for Segmentation

When training segmentation models with limited data, data augmentation is critical. However, unlike classification, **both the image AND the mask must be augmented together** using the same transformation.

**Common Augmentations for EO:**
- Rotation (90°, 180°, 270°) - valid for nadir satellite views
- Horizontal/vertical flips
- Random crops (with corresponding mask crops)
- Brightness/contrast adjustments (image only)

**What to Avoid:**
- ✗ Augmenting image without mask (misalignment)
- ✗ Severe geometric distortions (unrealistic for satellite data)
- ✗ Random rotations (may not match satellite geometry)

**Session 2 will demonstrate** proper augmentation for flood mapping.
:::
```

**Estimated Time:** 3-5 minutes  
**Placement:** Part 3 (Why U-Net is Popular - Data Efficiency section)  
**Length:** ~20-25 lines

---

### **4. BATCH NORMALIZATION vs DROPOUT** 🟢 VERY OPTIONAL

**What's Missing:**
- Brief mention of regularization techniques in U-Net

**Why This Matters:**
- Helps prevent overfitting
- Part of modern U-Net implementations

**Recommended:** Skip for now (Session 2 can cover if needed)
